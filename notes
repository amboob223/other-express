this app basicall shows how to render data from the api data after a get request from express
and rendr it using the effects and state hook
we useeffect to control the after effwcts of making a poatrequest and the rerendering
we use state to update the data
we use nodemon so we dont have to keep restarting the server
we use express to managae requset and responses to the seerver 
this is helping the backend 
when you do arrow with the parenthesis insidr the jsx psrt of a compoinenet we are renderung implicitly
today we did git remote remove origin to change the origin because we already had it set up to anither repository
s

//basically

-we got data from the backend and rendered it to the frontends
